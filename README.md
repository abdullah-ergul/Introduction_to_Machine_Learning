# Introduction to Machine Learning
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A starter guide github repository for people interested in AI and machine learning.  I chose the Python programming language because when I created this repository, it was widely used for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I also introduced and used libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn, etc. that are commonly used for data science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository you can find out what machine learning is and basic machine learning algorithms; like KNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes (etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also one of my personal goals to prove that machine learning is based on a purely mathematical and statistical basis.</p>
